                    <p>Hi There everyone from a very cold Glasgow, Scotland. My Name is Ross Fairbairn and well done/unlucky on finding my first web page creation. I know it looks terrible and its nothing too fancy and the code may not be perfect but we all need to start somewhere and this is that point for me. I currently work for Celtic Football Club(soccer to the Americans) in a hospitality role so this a bit of a career change for me. I am a student of <a target="blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-in-2018/"> The Complete Web Developer in 2018: Zero to Mastery</a> course on Udemy. The course so far has been very enjoyable and I would like to give a big thank you to the course creator Andrei Neagoie. I have very little experience of developing websites (as you can probably tell!!!) but so far the course has been brilliant in introducing the key features of html and css and the fact that this page even exists at all shows that I have learned many different skills that I didnt know just a few short days ago. </p>

                    <h1 class="cHead cHead-right">What Have I Learned</h1>

                    <p>If you are fimiliar with the course, this page has been created after completing section 8, lesson 68. So far we have covered the main languages used in front-end web development. This page was created by using a combination of HTML,CSS and bootstrap, all of which have been covered so far in the course. The creation of an image gallery using flexbox was the point I started to get really hooked on the course and was surprised how easy it was to set this up. I put this down to hard work of Andrei talking us through it in the videos and explaining everything very clearly. Andrei has provided some unexpected bonuses in the course such as giving a brief overview how the internet actually works and its history before we dive into the actual coding. I have also been intruduced to MailChimp and the massive developer world that is Github.</p>

                    <p>I know I have barely scratched the surface of the technologies introduced in the earlier sections of the course so I feel that more hours of experimenting with HTML,CSS and bootstrap is in order before moving on to learn about the likes of javascript and databases. I will also use this page as the building blocks of my own portfolio website. </p>
